## Communify

Communify is a platform that unites communities in action to advocate and expand social justice. 
Users can create, find, and RSVP to events in their community, and connect with other local users 
that share similar areas of concern and passion. Upcoming features to this application include more 
interaction between users - commenting on events, liking events, and direct messaging. Google Maps 
will be integrated into the application as well, enabling users to quickly and easily see a visual 
representation of all upcoming events in their area. The ability to easily share events across other 
social media platforms will also be added, giving the application a much wider potential audience to 
enable continued exposure and growth.
